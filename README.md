# Scikit-Learn
This project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of Machine Learning in python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my O'Reilly book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow:


Simply open the Jupyter notebooks you are interested in:

Using jupyter.org's notebook viewer
note: github.com's notebook viewer also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly,
or by cloning this repository and running Jupyter locally. This option lets you play around with the code. In this case, follow the installation instructions below.
